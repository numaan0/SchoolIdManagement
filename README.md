# SchoolIdManagement
This is a project developed for freelance client to manage ID card data at a one place and provide UI to clients so that clients can add data and make the procedure smooth.



About the Project:

A school ID card management system using Python Django, Bootstrap, and SQLite is a web-based application that allows schools to easily manage and track the issuance of ID cards to students and staff. The system utilizes the Django web framework,
which is written in Python and known for its ease of use and scalability. Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is used to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. SQLite, a lightweight and simple relational database, is used to store and retrieve data related to ID card issuance. The system would allow school admin to issue ID card to students and staff, 
track of the issued ID card, update and delete the record of the issued ID card. This system is easy to use, efficient and cost-effective solution for school ID card management.



To install in your local system:
